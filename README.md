- ‚ö†Ô∏è Immediate alerts for evacuation orders within 5 miles
- üó∫Ô∏è Accurate distance measurements using evacuation zone boundaries
- üîÑ Live data updates from official California fire and evacuation sources
- üì± Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices
- ‚ö° Fast computation of distances to thousands of boundary points
- üïí Timestamp tracking for latest evacuation order updates

2. Fetches active fire data from California Fire Incidents API
3. Fetches evacuation order data from Evacuation Zones API
4. Calculates distances to nearest fires and evacuation zones
5. Displays warnings if evacuation zones are within 5 miles
6. Updates data periodically to ensure latest information
